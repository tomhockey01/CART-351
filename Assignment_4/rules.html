      <div class="Riddle">
        <p>There is a certain amount of riddles, everyday a riddle is uploaded. Riddles are about certain objects, persons, and activities in/at Concordia. Whenever a riddle is online everybody can solve it, but depending on how quick you are different amount of points will be won. These points contribute towards your level. Whenever a user increases it’s level there is a possibility to create a new riddle!</p>


<p>Riddles can be solved by uploading a photo or simply by text. Whenever you create a riddle you can also choose the type of answer required.</p>
          <p>You can only answer a question if and only if your on the exact location. So stop reading and start moving! The goal is to move physically to the answer.
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can do all the riddles/clues whenever you want however, only 1 new riddle per day will be posted on the website</li>
            <li>Solve the clue first or in the top 10 and you get more points depending on your position.</li>
            <li>After top 10 first players to solve the riddle, each following players will earn the same 1 point as a participation reward.</li>
            <li>Top 7 players of the week will decide the next 7 riddles for the following week.</li>
            <li>In order to confirm that you actually went to the riddle’s location, each player will need to upload a picture with the “solution” as proof.</li>
            <li>When putting up a new riddle for next week, you can either post a written riddle or a photographic riddle. A written riddle can be anything in Concordia, including professors offices.</li>
            <li>The real goal is for people to learn more about their surroundings and in this case their University. There is no real advantage in cheating in this type of game because the real winner is the person learning new places that would not usually go to because of their daily routine.
</li>
            <li>Happy solving!</li>
        </ul>
